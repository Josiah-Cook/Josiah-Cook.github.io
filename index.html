        <h3 id="Subtitle"> Darpa's Centibots project </h3>
        <p id="Text"> 
            The Centibots project was funded by the 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=DARPA&oq=DARPA&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.860j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"> DARPA</a>
            , sought to prove that up to 100 robots could survey a potentially dangerous area, build a map in real 
            time, and seek items of interest. Centibots communicated with each other to coordinate their effort. 
            If one robot failed, another took over its task. The robots were completely autonomous, requiring no 
            human supervision.

        <h3 id="Subtitle"> World's Fastest Supercomputer - Earth Simulator </h3>
        <p id="Text">
            Developed by the Japanese government to create global climate models, the Earth Simulator is a 
            massively parallel, vector-based system that costs nearly 60 billion yen (roughly $600 million 
            at the time). A consortium of aerospace, energy, and marine science agencies undertook the 
            project, and the system was built by NEC around their SX-6 architecture. To protect it from 
            earthquakes, the building housing it was built using a seismic isolation system that used rubber 
            supports. The Earth Simulator was listed as the fastest supercomputer in the world from 2002 to 
            2004.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game"> MMORPG</a>
            begins to blossom with 
            the advent of faster computers with ever-better graphics. Eve Online allows 
            players to assume command of a spaceship, form alliances, and combat against 
            other players, or the environment. It represented a new concept where skills 
            were gained in real-time, even when a player was not logged into the game. By 
            2013, more than half-a-million users were regularly playing.

        <h3 id="Subtitle"> Blu-ray optical disc </h3>
        <p id="Text">
            Developed by a technology industry consortium, the Blu-ray optical disc is 
            released. It was intended to be the successor to the DVD, and was designed to 
            store high definition video at 1080p, while older DVDs were only capable of 
            480p resolution. The disc was named for the relatively short wavelength blue 
            laser that reads the data on the disc, which was capable of reading data stored
            at a higher density compared to the red laser used for reading DVDs. A brief 
            storage format battle ensued between Blu-ray and HD DVD, a format that was 
            being supported in an effort spearheaded by Toshiba. Blu-ray ultimately 
            prevailed.

        <p id="Text"> 
            After ten years as a series of strategy games, Blizzard Entertainment 
            launches World of Warcraft, a MMORPG version of their popular Warcraft 
            franchise. Centered on the fantasy world of Azeroth, Warcraft allows 
            players to choose an avatar to go “questing.” Players form guilds and 
            raiding parties, as well as form strong social, and even romantic, 
            connections through the game's built-in chat function. World of 
            Warcraft has been dominant in the MMORPG market since its release.

        <h3 id="Subtitle"> Google's IPO and its increasing popularity </h3>
        <p id="Text">
            In 2004, Google is the first major Web company to float a publicly traded stock 
            since the go-go days of the dot-com boom. This is a direct result of Google 
            solving the eternal problem plaguing all previous search engines - how to 
            profit from search. The secret turns out to be a discreet form of advertising, 
            based on auctioning off keywords to appear as "sponsored results" within a 
            search results page. Many people take Google's 
            <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp"> IPO</a>
            as a sign that the Web is not only back from its deep trough after the crash 
            but entering a new period of expansion, and many other IPOs follow Beneath it 
            all, of course, the Web continues to steadily grow as it has since the early 
            1990s.

        <p id="Text"> 
            Harkening back to the hobbyist era of personal computing in the 1970s, 
            Arduino begins as a project of the Interaction Design Institute, Ivrea,
            Italy. Each credit card-sized Arduino board consisted of an inexpensive
            microcontroller and signal connectors which made Arduinos ideal for 
            use in any application connecting to or monitoring the outside world. 
            The Arduino used a Java-based integrated development environment and 
            users could access a library of programs, called “Wiring,” that allowed 
            for simplified programming. Arduino soon became the main computer 
            platform of the worldwide “Maker” movement.

        <h3 id="Subtitle"> NASA Ames Research Center has the Supercomputer Columbia </h3>
        <p id="Text">
            Named in honor of the space shuttle which broke-up on re-entry, the 
            Columbia supercomputer is an important part of NASA's return to manned 
            spaceflight after the 2003 disaster. Columbia was used in space vehicle 
            analysis, including studying the Columbia disaster, but also in 
            astrophysics, weather and ocean modeling. At its introduction, it was 
            listed as the second fastest supercomputer in the world and this single 
            system increased NASA's supercomputing capacity 10-fold. The system was 
            kept at NASA Ames Research Center until 2013, when it was removed to 
            make way for two new supercomputers.

        <h3 id="Subtitle"> Amazon's Cloud Arises!! </h3>
        <p id="Text"> 
            Amazon Web Services is launched. It introduced a number of web services, 
            including Amazon Elastic Cloud 2 (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service 
            (S3). EC2 allowed users to rent virtual time on the cloud to scale server 
            capacity quickly and efficiently while only paying for what was used. Use 
            of the cloud eliminates the need for a company to maintain a complex 
            computing infrastructure on their own. Additionally, it saved space and 
            hassle in the form of less onsite server room square footage. S3 was a 
            cloud-based file hosting service that charged users monthly for the amount 
            of data stored and for the bandwidth of transferring data. Similar services, 
            like Google Drive, followed suit and created their own proprietary services.

        <h3 id="Subtitle"> Best Console Yet! </h3>
        <p id="Text">
            Nintendo's Wii game system does not merely introduce new games and 
            controllers, but new ways of interacting with game systems. The Wii 
            Remote combined advanced gesture recognition into gaming, using 
            accelerometer and optical sensor technologies to interact with the user. 
            These advances allowed for games to incorporate a wide range of player 
            physical movements. Several games came their own with specialized 
            controllers, including Wii Fit, Wii Tennis and Wii Boxing. The Wii console 
            also allowed access to online services providing games, news, and 
            entertainment offerings. It has sold more than a hundred million units 
            worldwide.
